Pixhawk/folding prop test
location: Richmond point field

goals: 
validate folding prop - works
evaluate efficiency (track voltage and current in cruise condition)
15.3 7.5 amps cruise 13.5 m/s 

changed cruise throttle to 65, cruise speed about 16 m/s @ 10 amps

changed cruise throttle to 75% 
cruise speed 17.5 @ 13-14 amps

validate gains for pixhawk - current values works great, holding alt fairly well

validate pixhawk auto mission - works


landed in stabilize, thinks its 12.5m above ground when its maybe -1 below launch

propeller survived 


optional: 
pid tuning
evaluate endurance
test auto landing


did 2 flights.

flight 1:
validated the propeller
changed desired cruised throttle to see different power consumptions

flight 2:
tested 



10/24/2014
test objectives:
dual launch hooks
airspeed sensor, validate operations. whats the ground alt once the plane lands?
endurance test
test if raising min speed would speed up the plane. (this would validate the plane will maintain min speed in windy conditions)
cruise throttle to be 47% --> 15m/s?
tune out whobbles in the air

Test 1: auto take off with dual hooks
89km planned
MIN_GNDSPD_CM = 700cm/s

to do:
change this to 17 and see if this affects aircraft speed. yes this works
monitor and tune gains


10/29/14 test flights
skip gyro calc = 1
change arspd_cal = 0
cruise 45% throttle, 13m/s
change fbw_min_spd to 10 m/s
max throttle 90%


gain tune
landing tests

landing pattern: 
alignment point to start decend point: 200 meters
start decend point to 0 ground point 541 meters
land point 65 meters

540 120

tan12 = 0.212
100/x = 471.7 meters

first land test failed, not decending fast enough
change land airspeed and sink rate
also change fbw min airspeed, too slow caused stall

change flight speed to 15 and min airspeed to 12

second land failed, went too far

third try, increase sink rate, reduce flare alt to 5, reduce flare time to 2 seconds
change flare alt to 5 and flare time to 6.

seems to be working okay except for the fact that the plane goes full throttle when landing. change land air speed to lower value perhaps would help



11/7/14 court ln walnut creek
objectives : gain tuning
landing

tecs_land_arspd = -1
TECS_LAND_THR - set to 0
TECS_LAND_SPDWGT
TECS_LAND_SINK = 0.5
TECS_TECS_LAND_TCONST = 2

not using airspeed for final landing at this moment


thr to pitch a little high


11/10/14

params: 
auto tune
PTCH2SRV_RLL

put into circle to tune ptch2srv_rll
re calibrate airspeed sensor
check TRIM_THROTTLE

if height osscilates increase TECS_PTCH_DAMP  by 0.1
TECS_THR_DAMP
and increase TECS_TIME_CONST by 1
TECS_INTEG_GAIN 
TECS_RLL2THR 

check integerator gains 


change land pitch back to 100 from 300

11-11-14
land flare sec to 10, moved land farther away


11/14/14
1:
first test flight successful
12 flare
5 seconds
- 3 degree flare 
550 wp to land
135 m overshoot

2:
next try flare at 
8 instead. 
3 seconds
15 degree climb out
landed 140 m overshoot
triggered time first

3:
next try 
flare at 5
time at 2
overshot by 100 meters

4:
next try 
flare at 3
time at 2
tecs_land_arspd = 13 from 12
overshot by 230 meters, pretty far!

5:
try tecs_land_arspd = 11
tecs_land_sink = 1
overshot by 150 meters

6:
try tecs_land_arspd = 12
tecs_land_sink = 1
flare at 5
time at 4
118m overshoot

7:
try the same again
94 meter overshoot

8: 
try the same again
120 m overshoot

9th: 
a little too fast on landing
push land pitch to -1 degree instead
180m

10th:
flare at 3 meters
flare at 2 seconds
overshoot 115 meters

11th:
do the same
with -3degree
overshot by 200 meters
wind directions changing

12th:
same setup
overshoot 146 meters

13th:
156 meters overshoot

14th:
141 meter overshoot

15th:
200 meter overshoot
crosswind involved

16th:
200 meters overshoot

17th:
reverse land direction with same params
561 out
100 sideways for alignment
210 meter overshoot
