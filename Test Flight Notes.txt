Pixhawk/folding prop test
location: Richmond point field

goals: 
validate folding prop - works
evaluate efficiency (track voltage and current in cruise condition)
15.3 7.5 amps cruise 13.5 m/s 

changed cruise throttle to 65, cruise speed about 16 m/s @ 10 amps

changed cruise throttle to 75% 
cruise speed 17.5 @ 13-14 amps

validate gains for pixhawk - current values works great, holding alt fairly well

validate pixhawk auto mission - works


landed in stabilize, thinks its 12.5m above ground when its maybe -1 below launch

propeller survived 


optional: 
pid tuning
evaluate endurance
test auto landing


did 2 flights.

flight 1:
validated the propeller
changed desired cruised throttle to see different power consumptions

flight 2:
tested 



10/24/2014
test objectives:
dual launch hooks
airspeed sensor, validate operations. whats the ground alt once the plane lands?
endurance test
test if raising min speed would speed up the plane. (this would validate the plane will maintain min speed in windy conditions)
cruise throttle to be 47% --> 15m/s?
tune out whobbles in the air

Test 1: auto take off with dual hooks
89km planned
MIN_GNDSPD_CM = 700cm/s

to do:
change this to 17 and see if this affects aircraft speed. yes this works
monitor and tune gains


10/29/14 test flights
skip gyro calc = 1
change arspd_cal = 0
cruise 45% throttle, 13m/s
change fbw_min_spd to 10 m/s
max throttle 90%


gain tune
landing tests

landing pattern: 
alignment point to start decend point: 200 meters
start decend point to 0 ground point 541 meters
land point 65 meters

540 120

tan12 = 0.212
100/x = 471.7 meters

first land test failed, not decending fast enough
change land airspeed and sink rate
also change fbw min airspeed, too slow caused stall

change flight speed to 15 and min airspeed to 12

second land failed, went too far

third try, increase sink rate, reduce flare alt to 5, reduce flare time to 2 seconds
change flare alt to 5 and flare time to 6.

seems to be working okay except for the fact that the plane goes full throttle when landing. change land air speed to lower value perhaps would help

turn off gyro calibration
turn off arspd callibration
land pattern
flare alt changed to 1
overshot 200 meters
with extra wp the landing just lagged.

without extra wp watch alt error

what if i put a wp at 10 meter instead
@ 57 meter from land wp
set land flare alt to 0

flight 5:
try setting wp 4 at 5 meters


flight 6:
try 300 again with original landing pattern

arspd calibration 1.13 for 303 seems to do the trick



last land with 300 undershoot bad
