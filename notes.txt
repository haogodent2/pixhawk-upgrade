Pixhawk/folding prop test
location: Richmond point field

goals: 
validate folding prop - works
evaluate efficiency (track voltage and current in cruise condition)
15.3 7.5 amps cruise 13.5 m/s 

changed cruise throttle to 65, cruise speed about 16 m/s @ 10 amps

changed cruise throttle to 75% 
cruise speed 17.5 @ 13-14 amps

validate gains for pixhawk - current values works great, holding alt fairly well

validate pixhawk auto mission - works


landed in stabilize, thinks its 12.5m above ground when its maybe -1 below launch

propeller survived 


optional: 
pid tuning
evaluate endurance
test auto landing


did 2 flights.

flight 1:
validated the propeller
changed desired cruised throttle to see different power consumptions

flight 2:
tested

test objectives:
dual launch hooks
airspeed sensor, validate operations. whats the ground alt once the plane lands?
endurance test
test if raising min speed would speed up the plane. (this would validate the plane will maintain min speed in windy conditions)
cruise throttle to be 47% --> 15m/s?
tune out whobbles in the air

Test 1: auto take off with dual hooks
89km planned
MIN_GNDSPD_CM = 700cm/s

to do:
SAVE PARAMS, date it!
change this to 17 and see if this affects aircraft speed.
monitor and tune gains
monitor power

try flying with 24 amps and see how the climb rate is. 



landing: decend 5m/s   or 12degrees
100/5 = 20 , 20*20 400 meters

12 degrees

tan(12)= 100/x ~ 500 meters

ARSPD_AUTOCAL = 1 , leave for 5 mins then change to 0

to do: change arspd_autocal to 0
do some calculations and
