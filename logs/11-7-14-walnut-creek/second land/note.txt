throttle turned off early, did not pitch up at all?

chang pitch cdegree to 300

change land to 800 meters out for 120 meters

tan(x)= 120/800  8.5 degrees


tan(10) = 100/x

x =100/tan(10)

700? compensate for lag on land

throttle went up after landing, why? 
15m/s landing speed was pretty good


lesson learned, elevons need to be harder, control horns need to  be clamping type
